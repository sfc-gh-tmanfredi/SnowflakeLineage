# SnowflakeLineage
Demonstration of Snowflake capabilities for Data and ML Model Lineage

This is a self-contained demo.  Simply download the notebooks file in this repo then import it as Notebooks in Snowsight (SnowflakeLineageDemo.ipynb and SnowflakeLineageDemo-Setup.ipynb)

1. Go to the notebook **SnowflakeLineageDemo-Setup** you just imported and execute each of the cells in order. This will set up your DB/Schema environment and create/populate the objects needed for this demo
2. Go to the notebook **SnowflakeLineageDemo** and execute each cell in order to demonstrate Snowflake Lineage capabilities for data and ML Models

For each of these notebooks, click the Packages dropdown on the upper right and search/install *snowflake-ml-python*
